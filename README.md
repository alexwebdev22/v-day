#Valentines day project

I present you a mini project I worked these days. In hopes of suprising my fiancÃ¨, I created this mini project using reactjs, css, and a new library(to me) called react-slick, pretty cool tool, might use later in my projects. So far, I worked these days on the functionality, giving bit touch of my love for her. #Valentinesday2025


This project is personal and can be used as a start if you may be interested in building soemmthing like this for your partner ðŸ˜„

Happy coding!
